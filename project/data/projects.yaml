    We published an analysis of precinct-level results and analysis very quickly after the 2018 midterm election thanks to a lot of prep work, including my data processing setup for all the House districts we were interested in. I worked the overnight shift to process results as they came in.

    BORDERLINE: Navigating the invisible boundary and physical barriers that define the U.S.-Mexico border
  description: >
    This 3-D scroll-driven map was a really fun project to work on. The basic framework of a slippy 3-D tiled map was built when I joined the project, but I wrote a lot of the interaction, motion and rendering code and took over the project as the lead developer partway through.
